  content: <p> In this workshop, we focus on the computational symmetry aspect through
    a series of challenges in which competitors submit algorithms for detecting different
    types of symmetry in natural scenes, i.e., detecting "symmetry in the wild".  We
    also invite various papers representing a number of tasks for which symmetry can
    play a critical role, including image/video editing, saliency/attention, 3D reconstruction,
    object recognition and segmentation, scene categorization, and urban scene parsing.<br

    \ Bohyung Han, POSTECH, Korea\n\t\t<p> I present novel supervised and semi-supervised\
    \ semantic segmentation algorithms by learning deconvolution networks, which are\
    \ recently investigated in POSTECH Computer Vision Lab. The deconvolution network\
    \ is constructed on top of the convolutional layers adopted from the VGG 16-layer\
    \ net. It is composed of deconvolution and unpooling layers, which identify pixel-wise\
    \ class labels and predict segmentation masks. Our supervised algorithm mitigates\
    \ the limitations of the existing methods based on fully convolutional networks\
    \ by integrating a deep deconvolution network and proposal-wise prediction; our\
    \ segmentation method typically identifies detailed structures and handles objects\
    \ at multiple scales naturally. Also, our semi-supervised facilitates employing\
    \ rich information from weak image-level annotations and achieving very nice performance\
    \ even with very small number of training examples having strong annotations.\
    \ Our networks demonstrate outstanding performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset,\

    \ Science Group\n\t\t<p> How quickly can we determine if an object satisfies some\

    \ Is it connected? If we need to answer such a question exactly, it requires at\
    \ least as much time as it takes to read the object. In this talk, we will focus\
    \ on approximate versions of these questions and will discuss how to solve them\
    \ in time that depends only on the approximation parameter, but not the size of\
    \ the input. In the talk, we will go over the model, some algorithms and their\

    \ \\>\n    <p> 333 Information Sciences and Technology Building <p \\>\n    <p>Filters\
    \ are everywhere in vision. They naturally encode a key redundancy in both natural\
    \ imagery and motion, specifically that natural observations are locally dependent\
    \ (in both space and time). Further, the convolution operation itself is especially\
    \ important, as it seamlessly encodes how local regions are dependent on one another.\
    \ The well-known field of Signal Processing presents some unique properties that\
    \ have hitherto been largely underutilized within Computer Vision and Machine\
    \ Learning and are particularly important when one considers applying convolutional\
    \ constraints to objectives involving big data. In this talk we will discuss how\
    \ these properties can be utilized to develop new algorithms for rapid object\
    \ detection/tracking through a framework we refer to as \"convolutional regression\"\
    .   <p/>\n    \n   <p> I will also discuss some of my laboratory's recent industrial\
    \ engagements. Of specific interest will be work we have recently completed in\
    \ the space of obtaining dense semantic 3D face scans using hand held mobile/tablet\
    \ devices. This technology has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of\
    \ traditional \"bricks and mortar\" retail by allowing for the virtual try on\
    \ of wearable merchandise (e.g. glasses, makeup, etc.) using handheld devices.<p\\\
    >\n    \n    <p>Bio: Simon Lucey is an Associate Research Professor within the\
    \ Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to this he was an Australian\
    \ Research Council (ARC) Future Fellow (2009-2013) and a Principal Research Scientist\
    \ at Australia's national science agency the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial\
    \ Research Organization (CSIRO). His research is motivated from a passion for\
    \ discovering the \"why?\" behind \"how?\" with respect to core problems in Artificial\
    \ Intelligence, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Simon leads the CI2CV laboratory,\
    \ one of the leading groups in the world for face and body analysis through computer\
    \ vision. He received his Ph.D. in 2003 from the Queensland University of Technology,\
    \ Australia. To his credit he has over 100 peer reviewed publications. He is currently\
    \ an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing, and has served\
    \ as Area Chair for conferences like ICPR (2012), CVPR (2014, 2015), ACCV (2014),\

  title: Dr. Robert Collins receives NSF Grant to develop efficient algorithms for
    crowd scene analysis
  content: '<p> LPAC has received a new NSF award "Distributed Combinatorial Optimization
    for Crowd-Scene Analysis" ($450K; PI: Robert Collins), jointly funded by the Division
    of Information & Intelligent Systems and Computing and Communication Foundations.  The
    goal of this three-year effort is to develop efficient computer vision algorithms
    based on distributed message passing for solving crowd-scene analysis tasks such
    as detection and tracking of closely spaced individuals. These and other vision
    tasks can be formulated as discrete combinatorial optimization problems, e.g.
    binary linear or quadratic programs, and studying their underlying mathematical
    structure is expected to yield insights that allow larger and more challenging
    problem instances to be addressed. Recent theoretical work proving the correctness
    of message passing for some classes of binary linear programming problems is being
    leveraged to develop practical vision algorithms for crowd scene analysis and
    extended to develop algorithms for finding good approximate solutions to harder
    problems. The project team is also exploring approximate inference methods based
    on randomization and on decomposition of large-scale problems into collections
    of interrelated subtasks that can be solved more efficiently and in parallel.'
