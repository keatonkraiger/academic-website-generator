  The HUB dataset consists of two 15-minute sequences taken in the Penn State student union building (also known as “The HUB”). The first sequence, called SU2-L, has low-density crowds, and the second sequence, SU2-H, has higher crowd density and is thus more difficult. Each sequence is broken into a series of short 20-second clips. All people in the middle frame of each clip were detected and tracked by human volunteers to collect ground truth trajectories.

  Examples of trajectories from two clips are shown in the Figure. The volunteers also labeled people that they thought were together in a small group.

  The grouping labels provided by six different volunteers were pooled together to produce a “human consensus” ground truth classification for every person in the scene, into categories of “alone”, “in a pair”, and “in a group of 3 or more”. Please see the Readme for more details on the data.
