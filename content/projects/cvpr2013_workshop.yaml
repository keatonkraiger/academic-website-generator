description: 
  Symmetry is a pervasive phenomenon present in all forms and scales in natural and man-made environments. It is not surprising, therefore, that humans, animals and insects have evolved an innate ability to perceive and take advantage of symmetry. What IS surprising is that perception and recognition of symmetry have yet to be fully explored in machine intelligence, in particular computer vision. Despite an understanding of how the concept of repeated patterns is generalized by the mathematics of group theory, and despite attempts over four decades to design algorithms that seek symmetry from digital data, there are very few effective computational tools for automated symmetry analysis available today. The goal of this competition is to benchmark state of the art symmetry detection algorithms (previously published and new algorithms) on real images.
