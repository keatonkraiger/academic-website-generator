description: |
  This research integrates theoretical, experimental, and algorithmic approaches to construct a novel conceptual framework for predicting and understanding the full range of regularity perception. The project explores both human perception by measuring brain activation and behavior, and machine perception through a computational framework for adaptive symmetry detection in computer vision. Using symmetry group theory as an organizing principle, the project aims to advance theories in pattern perception and enable new methods for detecting and analyzing real-world regularities.

  The interdisciplinary nature of this project bridges computer science, psychology, neuroscience, and mathematics. The outcomes will contribute to improving the robustness of automatic pattern detection in large digital datasets and could significantly impact various domains, including computer vision, data analysis, and cognitive sciences.
