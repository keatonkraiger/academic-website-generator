  Dance is a dynamic art form that reflects a wide range of cultural diversity and individuality. With the advancement of motion capture technology in combination with crowd-sourcing and machine learning algorithms, we explore the complex relationship between perceived dance quality/dancer gender, and dance movements/music. As a feasibility study, we construct a computational framework for an analysis-synthesis-feedback loop using a novel and synchronized multimedia <em>dance-music texture</em> representation. Furthermore, we integrate crowd sourcing, music and motion-capture data, and machine learning-based methods for dance segmentation, analysis and synthesis of new dancers. A quantitative validation of this framework on a mocap dataset of 172 dancers evaluated by more than 400 independent on-line raters demonstrates significant correlation between human perception and the algorithmically intended dance quality or gender of synthesized dancers. The technology illustrated in this work has a high potential to advance the multimedia entertainment industry via <em>Dancing With Turks</em>.
