description: 
  We built 4 static and 4 dynamic camera system in our laboratory by which we can obtain real-time indoor human activity sequence.

    - 4 GiGE static camera with fixed focal length lens
    - 4 GiGE dynamic camera with motorized zoom lens and PTU(Pan Tilt Unit)
    - 8 machines for the control of each camera connected by Gigabit ethernet

  Static camera has higher resolution(1360x1024) and maximum 20fps. 4 of this camera located at each corner of our laboratory can shot whole area of the room and used to detect, track and localize targeted object(Human) from 4 different angle.
  Dynamic camera has lower resolution(659x493) but higher maximum fram rate(90fps). This camera is mounted on the PTU and has a motorized(controlled) zoom lens. This camera will be used to zoom in targeted object, identify and track it obtaining closed shot sequence from 4 different angle.
  These two different types of camera system can be used seperately or can be used together sharaing object location information.
