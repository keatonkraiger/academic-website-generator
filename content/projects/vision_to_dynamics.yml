description: |
  Pose stability analysis is the key to understanding locomotion and control of body equilibrium, with applications in numerous fields such as kinesiology, medicine, and robotics. In biomechanics, Center of Pressure (CoP) is used in studies of human postural control and gait. We propose a novel approach to learn CoP from pose of a human body to aid stability analysis, learning foot pressure heatmaps (dynamics) from 2D human pose (kinematics) derived from video. We validated our learned results on a collection of long (5min +) choreographed Taiji (Tai Chi) sequences of multiple subjects with synchronized foot pressure and video data. Cross-subject validation results show promising performance, significantly outperforming the baseline methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our computation of center of pressure (CoP) approaches the expectations of corresponding lab-based measurements.

    description: "<br>The PSU Taiji MultiModal (PSU-TMM100) Dataset contains 100 Taiji motion sequences, 24-form Simplified Taiji-Quan, aka Tai Chi, performed by 10 human subjects. The dataset includes time-synchronized measurements: 
    <br>
    &emsp;- motion capture markers and body joints recorded using Vicon Nexus 2.6.1
    <br>
    &emsp;- foot pressure recorded using Tekscan F-scan 7.0 insole sensors \
    <br>
    &emsp;- 1080p video from two views recorded using Vicon Nexus 2.6.1 
    <br>
    Additionally, OpenPose and HRNet pose detection networks networks are applied on both video views to generate 2D and triangulated 3D vision-based joints estimates.
